        <p>Mars is the<strong>fourth</strong> planet 
        and the furthest terrestrial planet 
        from the Sun. The reddish color
         of its surface is due to finely
          grained iron(III) oxide dust in 
          the soil, giving it the nickname 
          "the Red Planet".</p>
        <h2><strong>ROTATION</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Radio-wave data from NASA's InSight 
            mission has provided the most precise
             measurement of Mars' rotation rate 
             ever made. The length of Mars' day
              is shortening by three-quarters of
             a millisecond each year as the planet's
              rotation spins up, according to new 
              results from NASA's InSight lander.

        <h3><strong>ORBIT</strong></h3>
        <p>Mars has an orbit with a semimajor axis
            of<em>1.524</em>astronomical units (228 
            million km), and an eccentricity of 
           <em> 0.0934</em>. The planet orbits the
            Sun in <em>687</em> days and travels<em>
            9.55</em> AU in doing so, making the 
            average orbital speed <em>24 </em>km/s.</p>
