        <p>Earth,<strong>third planet</strong> from the Sun and 
            the fifth largest planet in the solar
             system in terms of size and mass</p>
        <h2><strong>Rotation</strong></h2>
        <p>The Earth rotates on its axis relative
        to the Sun every <em>24.0</em> hours mean solar 
        time, with an inclination of<em>23.45</em>,degrees 
        from the plane of its orbit around the Sun. 
        Mean solar time represents an average of the
        variations caused by Earth's non-circular orbit.</p>
        <h3><strong>Orbit</strong></h3>
        <p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average
         distance of <em>149.60 </em>million km (92.96 
         million mi)in a counterclockwise 
         direction as viewed from above the 
         Northern Hemisphere. One complete orbit 
         takes <em>365.256</em> days (1 sidereal year), 
         during which time Earth has traveled 
        <em> 940</em> million km (584 million mi).
         Ignoring the influence of other Solar
         System bodies, Earth's orbit, also
         known as Earth's revolution, is an 
         ellipse with the Earth-Sun barycenter
         as one focus with a current
         eccentricity of <em>0.0167</em>. Since this
         value is close to zero, the center of 
         the orbit is relatively close to the 
         center of the Sun (relative to the size
          of the orbit).</p>
